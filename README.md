# OpenCV Playing Cards Detection


This was a group assignment for the "Visual Computing" class at the University of Aveiro, Portugal.
The project was to be done during the two week christmas break.

It was my first time using OpenCV, used to detect playing cards using Canny Edge Detection, Color Detection and Template Matching.
